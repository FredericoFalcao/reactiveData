## BACKLOG:
-----------------

### TO BE:

v0.3 - has an "export" and "import" module that converts sql data into a "git repo" / folder with code
v0.2 - has a function called "sql_read_hidrate()" that gives the foreign keys hidrated 
        - (useful for trigger functions like telegram outbox that need data like recipients hidrated)

## AS IS:

v0.1 - works.
